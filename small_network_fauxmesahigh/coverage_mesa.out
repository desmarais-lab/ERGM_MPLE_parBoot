Evaluating log-likelihood at the estimate. 
Starting maximum likelihood estimation via MCMLE:
Iteration 1 of at most 20: 
The log-likelihood improved by 0.3105 
Step length converged once. Increasing MCMC sample size.
Iteration 2 of at most 20: 
The log-likelihood improved by 0.04404 
Step length converged twice. Stopping.
